										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Omega Fire Ministries International believes in the fire operation of the Holy Spirit of God which refines, purifies and at the same time destroys. The mission of Omega Fire Ministries International is one that believes in judgment of God on the wicked. The ministry believes that the oppressions and demonic manipulations are real; we equally recognize that the authority of God’s Power is more real, is all-powerful and all-pervading.</p>
<p>Omega Fire Ministries holds as true, the belief that all power belongs to God and that the devil and his cohorts has no scriptural right to control and manipulate the destinies of the children of God. We also believe that it is the right of believers to live fulfilled lives. Consequently, the ministry believes it is saddled with the Divine mandate to restore those Divine rights of believers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Basically the team has been the very yard stick wherein the vision for the invasion for souls was formed from the onset in a bid to establish an institution and a rock which is formed to take the words of God to a greater height .</p>
<p>Locally, through the Apostle’s Ministration the set Vision has always been to set a standard based on his calling, even as he commenced in Lagos, with his calling to be a prophet of God and the word of God that he should go back to his home town and establish the headquarters of the House of God, one which he harkened unto.</p>
<p>Apostle Johnson Suleman with the Challenge he was faced with, as at the time never gave up, but waxed stronger, with the determination to fulfill his charge which was basically to take the word of the Almighty God of Host, to the nook and crannies of the world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his drive to achieve this aim is borne out of his desire through Celebration Television Network Limited and the Publishing house; Hosanna Publisher which have contributed immensely towards the propagation of the words of God via the media.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, based on this drive, there is the need for all well-meaning Christians, to sow into the ministry and partner with the ministry media force, Celebration Television Network Company and the drive aimed towards achieving the move and the work of God.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Campaign for the crusade seeks to further move the ministry of Apostle Johnson Suleman to the level the Lord God of Host has charged him with.</p>
<p>Apostle Johnson Suleman in the midst of his drive to reach souls all over the world has taken his time, lead by the Holy spirit as it were, to take the word of the lord through crusades and outreaches just as Jesus Christ did in his three and half years of reaching out to souls when he was in the world.</p>
<p>In a retrospect, several Ministration by the Apostle, was backed with proof of the works of the Lord based on the prophecies and the testimonies that followed sway from various crusade both Locally and internationally.</p>
<p>As part of his aim to win 5billion souls to the kingdom it is obvious that he cannot do it alone as such collective efforts in soul winning has  gone a long way in achieving this goal. Also in his daily and weekly voyages to actualize his soul winning goals much is required financially as such, keying into the visionary moves  by sowing  financially to the ministries for the continuous spread is necessary.</p>
